## Getting Started

First, run the installation for dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install

```

After, make a .env file which will contain the MONGODB_URI.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
